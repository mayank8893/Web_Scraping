# Amazon_data_scraping_using_selenium

For this project, I have scraped the amazon.in website using **selenium** package. I have done so using Chrome webdriver to open the webpage, then type in Smartphone under 10000 in the search box. I then scraped the title and price using **browser.find_elements()** function and providing the appropriate arguments for title and price by inspecting the webpage. The scraped data has then been exported to a csv file. Please see **amazon_web_scrapper.py** for the python code and **amazon_smartphone_under_Rs_10000.csv** for the exported csv file.

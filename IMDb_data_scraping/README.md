# IMDb_data_scraping

This web scraping project using **BeautifulSoup** is two fold. For the first part I have looked at **IMDb top 50 movies by popularity** using this link: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_100&ref_=adv_prv and then scraped the website to get **name, year, runtime, rating, metascore, vote count and gross box office** of the movies. I then exported this data to **csv** file.

For the second part, I check the movie list each day and **send myself an email if a new movie gets added to the list**. Please see the Jupyter notebboks for the code.

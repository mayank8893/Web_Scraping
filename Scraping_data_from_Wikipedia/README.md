# Scraping_data_from_Wikipedia

In this project, I have scraped data from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup. I looked at the Wikipedia page of the List of largest companies in the United States by revenue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue. This webpage had a table with the top 100 US companies by revenue. I then used **soup functions like find, find_all** and get to extract the table into a panda dataframe and then finally push it into a .csv file. Please see **Web_Scraping.ipynb** for the Jupyter Notebook and **companies.csv** for the extracted csv file.
